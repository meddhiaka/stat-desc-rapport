# Exam Project - Descriptive Statistics with Python

## Before Everything

<b>The Node environment inspired me to try creating another project using a different programming language, I like creating workflows for their privacy regarding environment variables and their automation scripts and many more stuff.

<i>That's why I'm using some utilities to replicate the same in the package.json but this time using <u>Python</u> as the main language.</i></b>
